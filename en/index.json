Moreover, the σAH normalized by Mz is independent of longitudinal conductivity (σxx ), which also indicates the characteristic of the nondissipative intrinsic mechanism. This intrinsic contribution could be understood from the density of Berry curvature integrated over occupied energies proposed recently for aperiodic materials, and the linear magnetization dependence can be understood from the fluctuations of spin orientation at the finite temperature. In such case, Berry curvature is proportional to spin magnetization in different orientations.

Here we present, in contrast, a type of superconductor that exhibits the exotic feature that TC is robust against large volume shrinkages (RSAVS, so naming them “RSAVS superconductors”) induced by applied pressure. Extraordinarily, our previous studies found that the TC in the two materials stays almost constant over a large pressure range, e.g., over 136 GPa in the (TaNb)0.67(HfZrTi)0.33 high-entropy alloy and 141 GPa in the NbTi commercial alloy. Here, we show that the RSAVS behavior also exists in another high-entropy alloy, (ScZrNbTa)0.6(RhPd)0.4, and in superconducting elemental Ta and Nb, indicating that this behavior occurs universally in a certain kind of superconductor, composed of only transition metal elements, with a body-centered cubic lattice. Our electronic structure calculations indicate that in the RSAVS state the contribution of the degenerate dx2-y2 and dz2 orbital electrons remains almost unchanged at the Fermi level, suggesting that these are the electrons that may play a crucial role in stabilizing the TC in the RSAVS state.

The tungsten layers are clipped by adjacent chalcogenide layers. The sandwich structure stacks along the c-axis with Van Der Waals bonding between layers.

WTe2 has attracted tremendous attention owing to its extremely large positive magneto-resistance {MR = [(ρH−ρ0)/ρ0]×100%} without saturation. Ali et al.  found that WTe2’s MR reaches as large as 1.3×10 7% in a high magnetic field of 60 T at 0.53 K. The MR effect is believed to arise from the perfect compensation of electron and hole populations. In November 2014, Pletikosić et al. demonstrated that WTe2 possesses two pairs of electron and hole pockets with similar sizes through the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments. Subsequently, Cai et al. observed that the ratio between electrons and holes changes with increasing pressure, which leads to the decrease of its MR. However, the relationships between the electron-hole compensation mechanism and the temperature or magnetic field direction have not been researched. Therefore, in the present work, through a careful examination of the magnetic field dependent MR curves at different temperatures and magnetic field directions, the field dependent MR slightly deviates from an H2 behavior at high temperatures, but approaches to a pure H2 field dependence as the temperature is lowered.

Careful polarized measurements allow us to clearly resolve the four-fold symmetry of the B1g mode, which put strong constraints on possible point group symmetries of the system with Co vacancies. The temperature-dependent measurements demonstrate that the anomalies in both frequency and width of the B1g mode occur around Neel temperature TN. The anomalies are considered to be related to the gap opening near the magnetic transition. The study may shed light on the structural and magnetic changes and their correlations with superconductivity in 122 systems.","tags":null,"title":"Raman scattering studies on the collapsed phase of CaCo2As2","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The parent of copper oxide superconductor is studied by high-voltage fine control techniques, including high-voltage in situ resistance, reluctance, Hall effect, magnetic susceptibility, etc. These different methods are combined to provide a more complete picture of the interaction between the degrees of freedom in the related system.\n","date":1460073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1460073600,"objectID":"6c4d61990d0d3319cac131c5067b9bff","permalink":"https://Haremaster.github.io/en/post/parent-effect-of-pressure-on-copper-oxide-superconductor/","publishdate":"2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/parent-effect-of-pressure-on-copper-oxide-superconductor/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Parent effect of pressure on copper oxide superconductor","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"When the scale of a material is comparable to one of its characteristic lengths, it is possible to exhibit physical properties different from macroscopic scale samples.

Our study reveals that the optical conductivity of TaAs features a narrow Drude response alongside a conspicuous linear dependence on frequency. The weight of the Drude peak decreases upon cooling, following a T 2 temperature dependence, in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Two linear components with distinct slopes dominate the low-temperature optical conductivity. A comparison between our experimental results and theoretical calculations suggests that the linear conductivity below ∼230 cm−1 arises purely from interband transitions near the Weyl points, providing rich information about the Weyl semimetal state in TaAs.","tags":null,"title":"Optical spectroscopy of the Weyl semimetal TaAs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1455926400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1455926400,"objectID":"94475f3d7392d69fb5c8dcfbc0a216f5","permalink":"https://Haremaster.github.io/en/publication/chinese-phys.-b-25-047401-2016/","publishdate":"2022-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/chinese-phys.-b-25-047401-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"We present magnetotransport studies on a series of BaFe2−xNixAs2 (0.03 ≤ x ≤ 0.10) single crystals.

FLSC is suppressed by an external magnetic field in a manner similar to the suppression of bulk superconductivity in an optimally-doped (x = 0.10) compound, suggesting the same possible origin as the bulk superconductivity. Our magnetoresistivity measurements reveal that FLSC persists up to the optimal doping and disappears in the overdoped regime where the long-range antiferromagnetic order is completely suppressed, pointing to a close relation between FLSC and the magnetic order.","tags":null,"title":"Magnetoresistivity and filamentary superconductivity in nickel-doped BaFe2As2","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://Haremaster.github.io/en/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact us","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"80946339e8d5c45f8259c01a6075d4c1","permalink":"https://Haremaster.github.io/en/index/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/index/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Home","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://Haremaster.github.io/en/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"widget_page"}]
