Here, we show that the RSAVS behavior also exists in another high-entropy alloy, (ScZrNbTa)0.6(RhPd)0.4, and in superconducting elemental Ta and Nb, indicating that this behavior occurs universally in a certain kind of superconductor, composed of only transition metal elements, with a body-centered cubic lattice. Our electronic structure calculations indicate that in the RSAVS state the contribution of the degenerate dx2-y2 and dz2 orbital electrons remains almost unchanged at the Fermi level, suggesting that these are the electrons that may play a crucial role in stabilizing the TC in the RSAVS state.

The tungsten layers are clipped by adjacent chalcogenide layers. The sandwich structure stacks along the c-axis with Van Der Waals bonding between layers. Particularly, tungsten chains are formed along the a-axis within the dichalcogenide layers. WTe2 has attracted tremendous attention owing to its extremely large positive magneto-resistance {MR = [(ÏHâÏ0)/Ï0]Ã100%} without saturation. Ali et al.  found that WTe2âs MR reaches as large as 1.3Ã10 7% in a high magnetic field of 60 T at 0.53 K. The MR effect is believed to arise from the perfect compensation of electron and hole populations. In November 2014, PletikosiÄ et al. demonstrated that WTe2 possesses two pairs of electron and hole pockets with similar sizes through the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments. Subsequently, Cai et al. observed that the ratio between electrons and holes changes with increasing pressure, which leads to the decrease of its MR. However, the relationships between the electron-hole compensation mechanism and the temperature or magnetic field direction have not been researched. Therefore, in the present work, through a careful examination of the magnetic field dependent MR curves at different temperatures and magnetic field directions, the field dependent MR slightly deviates from an H2 behavior at high temperatures, but approaches to a pure H2 field dependence as the temperature is lowered. This result indicates that the electron-hole compensation improves with decreasing temperature. The MR exhibits a pure H2 dependence in various magnetic field directions at 2 K.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of temperature and magnetic field direction on the electron-hole compensation in WTe2","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461110400,"objectID":"eb5f09a71f71f18983579aa9dbb3083f","permalink":"https://Haremaster.github.io/en/publication/chinese-phys.-b-25-067803-2016/","publishdate":"2022-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/chinese-phys.-b-25-067803-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work, Raman scattering measurements have been performed on the collapsed phase CaCo2As2 crystals. At least 8 Raman modes were observed at room temperature though CaCo2As2 is structurally similar to other 122 compounds like BaFe2As2. Two Raman modes are assigned to the intrinsic A1g and B1g of this material system respectively. The other ones are considered to originate from the local vibrations relevant to cobalt vacancies. Careful polarized measurements allow us to clearly resolve the four-fold symmetry of the B1g mode, which put strong constraints on possible point group symmetries of the system with Co vacancies. The temperature-dependent measurements demonstrate that the anomalies in both frequency and width of the B1g mode occur around Neel temperature TN. The anomalies are considered to be related to the gap opening near the magnetic transition. The study may shed light on the structural and magnetic changes and their correlations with superconductivity in 122 systems.","tags":null,"title":"Raman scattering studies on the collapsed phase of CaCo2As2","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The parent of copper oxide superconductor is studied by high-voltage fine control techniques, including high-voltage in situ resistance, reluctance, Hall effect, magnetic susceptibility, etc. These different methods are combined to provide a more complete picture of the interaction between the degrees of freedom in the related system.\n","date":1460073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1460073600,"objectID":"6c4d61990d0d3319cac131c5067b9bff","permalink":"https://Haremaster.github.io/en/post/parent-effect-of-pressure-on-copper-oxide-superconductor/","publishdate":"2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/parent-effect-of-pressure-on-copper-oxide-superconductor/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Parent effect of pressure on copper oxide superconductor","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"When the scale of a material is comparable to one of its characteristic lengths, it is possible to exhibit physical properties different from macroscopic scale samples.
